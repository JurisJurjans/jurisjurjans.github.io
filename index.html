			<h4>Iron Maiden-The Clairvoyant</h4>
			<p><strong>Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls<br>
Is this a dream or is it now<br>
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes<br>
I wonder why, I wonder how <br>
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day  <br>           
I feel a strength, an inner fire<br>
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore<br>
There's a time to live and a time to die<br>
When it's time to meet the maker<br>
There's a time to live but isn't it strange<br>
That as soon as you're born you're dying<br>
There's a time to live and a time to die<br>
When it's time to meet the maker<br>
There's a time to live but isn't it strange<br>
That as soon as you're born you're dying<br>
Just by looking through your eyes<br>
He could see the future penetrating right in through you mind<br>
See the truth and see your lies<br>
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise</strong></p>
